# skrifheim Version Plan

Status: planning document

Tags use:

```text
v0.N.0      milestone release
v0.N.P      patch/fix release
v1.0.0      first serious production-ready database
```

## Release Principles

Every release must have:

- definition of done,
- a clean stop point before any tag work,
- local verification command,
- rootless Podman status,
- security review notes,
- a pentest handoff and resolution pass,
- known limitations,
- release notes,
- no hidden dependency on one developer machine.

## Clean Stop And Pentest Rule

Each version has a deliberate clean stop. When implementation criteria are done,
the work stops before tagging and the maintainer is told:

```text
vX.Y.Z implementation stop reached. Run pentest for this exact commit.
```

No tag is created at that point.

Pentest flow:

1. Implementation reaches the version stop point.
2. Local gates pass: `scripts/checks.sh`, `cargo deny check`, and `cargo audit`.
3. The maintainer runs pentest and writes findings to root `PENTEST.md`.
4. The findings are reviewed and fixed.
5. `PENTEST.md` is removed after the findings are handled.
6. Local gates are run again.
7. A permanent report is written at `security/pentest/<tag>.md` only when the
   exact commit is ready to tag and the result is `Status: PASS`.
8. Tagging and pushing tags happen only when explicitly requested.

Root `PENTEST.md` is temporary scratch input. It must not be committed, and the
release metadata validator fails while it exists.
